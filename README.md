# The Bookshelf
## _A sort of reading list_

I made this project as a part of the [Modern Js](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/) course by The Net Ninja, on Udemy.
Ok, that one was supposed to be a to-do list, but I work at the "_Complicating Simple & Straightforward Businesses Bureau_" (employee of the month).
I know there are things yet to fix (like the styling), or that could have been done better, please be kind.
